# Versioned Rails Routes

Versioned Rails Routes adds a set of conventions to the Rails Routing DSL
specifically designed to handle versionsed HTTP APIs.

Versioned Rails Routes adds a `version` method to the Rails Routing DSL.

This extends Routing to limit positive route match results to only requests
for a HTTP verb/path combination that _also_ includes an `Accept` header
[specify a specific version](http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2011-07-03-nobody-understands-rest-or-http).

Routes will match any requested version that is equal to or less than the
requested version, allowing new versions to be frequently be added with minimal
disruption to the public-facing API.

Example:

```ruby
version(4) do
  # All requests to photos will match here for
  # version 4 only
  resources :photos
end

version(3) do
  # All requests to photos will match here for
  # version 3 only
  resources :photos
end

version(2) do
  # All requests to tweets will match here for
  # versions 4, 3, and 2
  resources :tweets

  # Requests to :videos will match here for
  # versions 4, 3, and 2.
  match "/videos(/:id')", via: :all, :to => proc {|env| [404, {}, ["Not Found"]] }
end

version(1) do
  # All requests to photos will match here for
  # versions 2 and 1.
  # versions 3, and 4 will match the route defined in version(3)
  resources :photos

  # All requests to photos will match here for
  # versions 4, 3, 2 and 1
  resources :articles

  # All requests to photos will match here for
  # versions 1 only
  # versions 2, 3, and 4 will match the route defined in version(2)
  resources :videos
end
```

### Defining Versioned Routes
Versioned routes are defined with the `version` method. `version` takes a
block and all routes defined in that block are limited to that version number
(or higher) unless the route is redefined at a higher version (see Fallthrough
Behavior), deprecated (see Deprecating Routes In A Version).

The full routing API is available within the block. Calls to `resource(s)`
will result in a namespaced controller.


```ruby
version(5) do
  # the full routing API is available here.
  get 'some_action', controller: 'foo'

  # controller will be V5::TweetsController
  # located in controllers/v5/tweets_controller.rb
  resources :tweets
end
```

### Cascading Behavior
Requests for a version match any routes declared with a version number equal
or less than the requested version.

Given the following routes:

```ruby
version(2) do
  resources :photos
end

version(1) do
  resources :friends
end
```

`GET` requests to '/friends' with an `Accept` header containing `version=2`
will cascade down to the the v1 `friends` resources.

This allows the v2 API to act as though it was defined like this:

```ruby
version(2) do
  resources :photos
  resources :friends
end
```

without the need for API consumers to know (or care) that the `:friends`
resource was not duplicated for v2.

Requests to the `:friends` resource, with an `Accept` header containing
`version=1` will `404` (there is no route defined in version <= 1 that matches
the route)

### Version Ordering
Requests for a version match any routes with a version number equal or less
than the requested version. To ensure matching occurs in the proper order,
higher number versions must be declared before lower number versions


Good:

```ruby
version(2) do
  resources :photos
end

version(1) do
  resources :photos
end
```

You're gonna have a bad time:


```ruby
version(1) do
  resources :photos
end

version(2) do
  resources :photos
end
```

As such, route ordering precedence is important and higher numbered versions
*MUST* appear earlier in the route set to correctly match.

Requests to :photos resources defined below where the Accept header is
`version=2` would incorrectly match to the version `1` routes because the `1`
is less than `2`.

```ruby
version(1) do
  resources :photos
end

version(2) do
  resources :photos
end
```

Requests to :photos resources defined below where the Accept header is
`version=2` will correctly match to the version `2` routes.

```ruby
version(2) do
  resources :photos
end

version(1) do
  resources :photos
end
```

### Removing Older Versions

When an older version is no longer in use, you should delete the block and
move any routes not redefined in a higher version into the new lowest defined
version.

Given a routes definition where we'd like to remove v1:

```ruby
version(3) do
  resources :photos
end

version(2) do
  resources :photos
end

version(1) do
  resources :friends
  resources :apartments
end
```

Requests to `/friends`  and `/apartments` for either v3 or v2 are falling
through to the definition for v1.

If `apartments` is being removed but `friends` is beign retained with the
removal of v1 redefine your routes like this:

```ruby
version(3) do
  resources :photos
end

version(2) do
  resources :photos
  resources :friends, controller: 'v1/friends'
end
```

Alternatively, you could move all the files for `friends` from the `v1`
directory to the `v2` directory and avoid having to provide a `controller`
option.

### Deprecate routes

Wrapping routes in a `deprecate` block will return a `X-Deprecated-Endpoint` header in the response for those routes.

NOTE: You must add this gem's custom `RailsVersionedRouting::Middleware` middleware for this functionality to work.

In your application.rb -

```
config.middleware.use RailsVersionedRouting::Middleware
```

Routing example-

```ruby
version(3) do
  ...
end

version(2) do
  ...

  deprecated do
    resources :photos, only: [:show]
  end
end

version(1) do
  ...

  resources :photos, only: [:show]
end
```

In the above example, the photos show route is still accessible in v1, but will return a `X-Deprecated-Endpoint` header when accessed in v2 and v3.

Header-

```
X-Deprecated-Endpoint: This endpoint will be removed in an upcoming api version
```

### Remove routes

There are probably cases that older versions of your api contain routes that you do not want exposed in your new version. You can use the `removed` functionality to get this behavior.

Wrapping routes in a `removed` block will reroute to your applications 404 route when that route is accessed.

```ruby
version(3) do
  ...
end

version(2) do
  ...

  removed do
    resources :photos, only: [:show]
  end
end

version(1) do
  ...

  resources :photos, only: [:show]
end
```

In the above example, the photos show route is still accessible in v1, but will return a 404 when accessed in v2 and v3.
